# IAAS Curriculum

In the following the different courses provided by the Institute of Architecture of Application Systems ([IAAS](http://www.iaas.uni-stuttgart.de/institut/mitarbeiter/indexE.php)) are discussed. Several clusters of courses emphasizing different foci are recommended.

## Subject Areas of IAAS Research and Teaching

The term *application system* is a piece of software supporting one or more core business activities of an enterprise. Typically, such a system 

* covers essential parts of the business activities of an enterprise,
* processes large amounts of persistent data, 
* enables a huge amount of users to operate concurrently with the system, and
* exchanges information with similar systems. 

An application system directly supports the business activities of an enterprise. Thus, it must satisfy strong requirements in terms of *non-functional properties* like availability, scalability, resiliency, and performance.

IAAS is concerned with the *architecture* of such enterprise systems, i.e. their underlying structure: What kind of building blocks and connections between them are needed to build such a system and guarantee its non-functional properties? In this context, IAAS is focussed on *middleware*, i.e. what kind of middleware is needed in the componentry of an architure of an application system, and how is such middleware used properly. Another concern are proper paradigms to *model* and specify application systems as well as their *compliance* with non-functional properties. 

In order to enable proper support of the various business activities of enterprises, IAAS investigates the role of *business processes* in application systems. Both, proper modelling of business processes as well as middleware needed to support them (so-called *workflow systems* or *process management systems*) as discussed. Business processes are considered as *programs in the large* and the composition of applications via business processes is investigated in terms of functionality as well as non-functional properties.

To support data exchange between application systems, IAAS is foucssing on *messaging systems* (message queuing, publish/subscribe) and *service technologies*. *Service-oriented computing* (SoC) and *Service-oriented Architecture* (SOA) are studied in general, specific service technology like *Web Services* and *REST*-based systems are investigated in particular. 

To support the operational requirements of applications systems like automatic provisioning and deployment as well as automatic management, the use of *Cloud Computing* as well as proper Cloud middleware and Cloud technologies are investigated. *Application topologies* and corresponding modeling languages are of particular interest. 

More and more, services are not only realized by software or human beings, but by also by sensors and actuators. Thus, IAAS is also concerned with the *Internet of Things* (IoT). 

*Transaction models* are discussed to ensure the robustness of application systems. In addition, the IAAS studies *optimization*-potentials of application systems in general, and of business processes in particular.

To support the transfer of research results into practice, IAAS has a special focus on patterns and *pattern lanugages*. Several pattern language have been proposed by IAAS. Furthermore, pattern languages themselves are a research focus of IAAS.

Finally, several application domains are of high interest at IAAS like *simulation technology*, *eScience*, *Digital Humanities*, and *manufacturing systems*.

This whole spectrum of topics is reflected in both, the research projects as well as the various courses of the IAAS. 


## The Course Spectrum

The following figure shows the courses provided by IAAS. The layering of the courses from bottom to top is a first indicator of the sequence the courses should be taken - more details below.

Dashed lines mean that these courses are not mandatory to any of the course clusters below. Nevertheless, they should be considered to complete the understanding of the overall subject area of IAAS.
